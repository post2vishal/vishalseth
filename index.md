## About Me

Hello! I'm Vishal Seth, an alumnus of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), Surat, with a passion for leveraging AI, data analytics, and open-source technologies to drive positive change. As an ethical researcher and digital marketing strategist, I specialize in creating innovative solutions that blend technology with social impact— from sustainable education platforms to blockchain-driven transparency in governance.

My journey spans digital marketing, cybersecurity staffing, and academic publishing, where I emphasize transparency and accessibility. I'm deeply committed to initiatives like the SHRI (Sustainable Honest Research Initiative) for ethical open research and Prakriti School's nature-inspired learning model. Currently, I lead LoveTech India, providing staffing solutions in cybersecurity and futuristic tech while contributing to open-source projects that empower underserved communities.

When not coding or strategizing, you'll find me exploring circular economy models or advocating for a "Transparent Constitution" in India.
